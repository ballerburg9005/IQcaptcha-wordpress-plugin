work in progress
================
The plugin is usable ... but this literally is just a fork of BestWebSoft's reCAPTCHA plugin, where I replaced all the URL and brand strings plus worked out a few bugs and nothing more. The settings are totally misfit. There is probably tons of advertizement for "ballerburg9005" now, undue credit, etc. It uses the API from iqcaptcha.us.to and doesn't self-host it. There is still much work to be done.
